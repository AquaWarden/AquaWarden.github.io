# AquaWarden

This is the offical website of the YouTube creator [AquaWarden](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIKujGJttn8v4-E5LQ7L6Cw). I make [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) videos. 

## Livestreams
I host livestreams about once a month. My next livestream will be in July (exact date TBD). You can join the Minecraft servers I host my livestreams on!

## Videos
I publish full length videos about once a month and publish YouTube shorts once or twice a week.
